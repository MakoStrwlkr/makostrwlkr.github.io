This will be an experimental blog post, where I test out the idea of making an article
where I write one section each day. I was inspired to try this approach because, otherwise,
I doubted whether I would ever have the motivation to finish this ambitious article.

The purpose of this writing exercise is, as the title suggests, to look back at my time at
UofT as an undergrad, and to draw a few key lessons that I should remember while I am at
Waterloo as a grad student.
