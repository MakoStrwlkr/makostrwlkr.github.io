During Summer 2021, I worked with [Dr. Jakob Kottmann](https://jakobkottmann.com/) (now Prof. at UAugsburg) in the [Matter Lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) group of [Prof. Aspuru-Guzik](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Ag_6KEgAAAAJ&hl=en) in creating an [automatized implementation of nonunitary embeddings of quantum operators](https://github.com/MakoStrwlkr/nonunitary-embeddings), and looked at implementing applications of this method in measurement reduction and quantum simulation.
