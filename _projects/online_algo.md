During Summer 2022, I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/">Prof. Allan Borodin</a> on the study of online algorithms. While I was not able to create any original algorithms, I identified <a href="/assets/docs/Open_problems_in_online_algorithms.pdf">several open problems</a> (as of 2022), and created an overview of the [current progress on the prophet secretary problem](#). I also learnt <a href="/projects/fair_cake/"> how to cut cake</a>, on which I have given some talks.
