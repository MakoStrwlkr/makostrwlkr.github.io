This page collects material I organised during a preliminary literature review before
starting my latest ongoing project on studying quantum strategies for imitation games.
These notes are organised into two components:
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/mwycbywfmdcr#c4d7b0">the first set of notes</a>
consists of a review to C\*-algebras and their representations, while
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/wnzmyxjfwkmq#ff60f3">the second set of notes</a>
introduces how to study strategies for games using techniques from operator algebra.
