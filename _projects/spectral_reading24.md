This page collects material I compiled over the course of a reading group in Prof. Lap Chi Lau's group during the Fall 2024 semester.

- <a href="/assets/docs/Proof_of_Continuous_Functional_Calculus.pdf">Proof of continuous functional calculus</a>
- <a href="/assets/docs/FP-notes-4.pdf">Typeset notes accompanying a presentation on the R-transform, free convolutions, products of free elements</a>
- - A previous version of these notes had an error in Proposition 2.7. This has now been fixed.
- - <a href="/assets/docs/FP-presentation-4-updated.pdf">Handwritten notes from the presentation itself</a>
- (To be added this weekend) Notes for a presentation on Gaussian random matrices and intro to strong convergence
