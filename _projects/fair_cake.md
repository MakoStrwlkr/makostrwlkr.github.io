I gave a <a href="/assets/docs/Online_resource_allocation_2.pdf">talk on fair online cake-cutting</a> at an informal Theory Student Seminar hosted by the CS Theory group at UofT. Previously, I gave a shorter version of this same talk at CUMC 2022 (for which I was supported by the DCS summer research award).
