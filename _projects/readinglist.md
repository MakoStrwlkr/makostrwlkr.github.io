# Background and organisation

I made this list because I often get carried away and try to learn too many things at once. In my limited experience, I have noticed that I make better progress when I focus on only a few (*read: 1 or 2*) things at once. To mitigate endlessly procrastinating on learning, I made this list solely to keep track of whatever I can take on. Materials are organised loosely in terms of the broad category they fit into best.

Most (if not all) of these are (legally) available for free online, if you know where to look. I am open to exchanging any of the non-academic books, if you're nearby Waterloo or Toronto, and I have the book you desire! For my previous reading lists, check out <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/arkaprava/misc.html">my old website</a>.

## Cool papers
I stopped maintaining an online list of papers to read, since there's too many of them and updating it is a hassle. Here's a brief selection of important (according to my taste) papers that I hope to eventually get around to.
- MIP* = RE
- Strong Convergence
- Constructing Random Unitaries
- LCHS
- Tight Bounds for Zig-Zag
