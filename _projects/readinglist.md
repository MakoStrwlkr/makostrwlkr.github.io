# Background and organisation

I made this list because I often get carried away and try to learn too many things at once. In my limited experience, I have noticed that I make better progress when I focus on only a few (*read: 1 or 2*) things at once. To mitigate endlessly procrastinating on learning, I made this list solely to keep track of whatever I can take on. Materials are organised loosely in terms of the broad category they fit into best.
