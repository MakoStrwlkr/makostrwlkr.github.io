This page collects material I organised during a preliminary literature review before
starting my latest ongoing project on studying quantum strategies for imitation games.
These notes are organised into two components: <a href="#">the first set of notes</a>
consists of a review to C\*-algebras and their representations, while <a href="#">the
second set of notes</a> introduces how to study strategies for games using techniques
from operator algebra.
