I completed my HBSc with High Distinction from [Trinity College](https://www.trinity.utoronto.ca/) at [UofT](https://www.utoronto.ca/)! :sparkles: :smile:

Here is a link to a blog post (coming soon) about my time as an undergrad at UofT's CS Theory group,
and also promises to myself for my upcoming time as a grad student at UW.
