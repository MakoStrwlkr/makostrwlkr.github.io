Welcome to my webpage! I am an incoming MMath student at the [Department of Combinatorics & Optimisation](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization), at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Lap Chi Lau](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lapchi/).

My research interests lie broadly in the applications of operator algebras to theoretical CS, mainly in spectral graph theory, but also for quantum information, and coding theory.

I completed my HBSc in the Computer Science and Mathematics specialist programs from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), where I also studied physics. During my undergraduate years, I focused on quantum algorithms, and I had the honour of working with [Prof. Nathan Wiebe](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DSgKHOQAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my free time, I like to play chess (check out [my opening study](https://lichess.org/study/EOAymW9A)!) or [shogi](https://lishogi.org/@/makostrwlkr). You might also be interested in my blog, [BQPComplete](/blog/). Feel free to reach out to me at `arka [at] cs [dot] toronto [dot] edu`!
