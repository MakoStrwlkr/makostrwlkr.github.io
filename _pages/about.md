Welcome to my webpage! I am an incoming MMath student at the [Department of Combinatorics & Optimisation](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization), at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Lap Chi Lau](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lapchi/), where I will be working on spectral graph theory.

My other interests include applications of operator algebras to theoretical CS, quantum information theory, and coding theory. I previously completed my H.BS. from the University of Toronto, studying computer science, mathematics, and physics, where I focused on quantum algorithms. Feel free to reach out, as I am always eager to learn more!

In my free time, I like to play chess (check out [my opening study](https://lichess.org/study/EOAymW9A)!) or [shogi](https://lishogi.org/@/makostrwlkr).
