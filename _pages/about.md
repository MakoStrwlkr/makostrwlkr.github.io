Welcome to my webpage! I am an undergraduate at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and maths, plus dabbling in physics occassionally. I am interested in quantum computing (Hamiltonian simulation and quantum information), theoretical computer science (hardness of approximation and complexity theory) and related areas of mathematics (operator algebras and discrete mathematics).

Feel free to reach out, as I am always eager to learn more!

In my free time, I like to play chess (check out [my opening study](https://lichess.org/study/EOAymW9A)!) or [shogi](https://lishogi.org/@/makostrwlkr).
