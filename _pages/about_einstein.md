<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `me_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Welcome to my webpage! I am an incoming graduate student at the [Department of Combinatorics & Optimisation](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization), at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Prof. Lap Chi Lau](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lapchi/), where I will be working on spectral graph theory.

My other interests include applications of operator algebras to theoretical CS, quantum information theory, and coding theory. I previously completed my H.BS. from the University of Toronto, studying computer science, mathematics, and physics, where I focused on quantum algorithms. Feel free to reach out, as I am always eager to learn more!

In my free time, I like to play chess (check out [my opening study](https://lichess.org/study/EOAymW9A)!) or [shogi](https://lishogi.org/@/makostrwlkr).
